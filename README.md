# Raw Data for "The Being Beyond the Borderline, Neurotypical 2e" Autoethnography

This repository contains the raw conversation data supporting the autoethnographic study titled "The Being Beyond the Borderline, Neurotypical 2e: An Autoethnography of Self-Structuring with AI". This data reflects the researcher's daily interactions with large language models (GPT) and their process of emotional and metacognitive structuring.

## Data Structure

* **TimeStage:** This column indicates the distinct phases of the researcher's emotional structuring journey (e.g., G-Void, G-First, G-Label, G-Routine, G-Ready).
* **Emotion (E-):** This column categorizes the researcher's expressed emotional states during the interactions (e.g., E-ANX for anxiety, E-CAL for calmness, E-INI for initial/unstable emotions, E-CLA for clarity, etc.).
* **GPT Response Type (R-):** This column classifies the type of response received from GPT (e.g., R-CR for structuring attempts, R-ICG for incoherent/irrational responses like hallucination, R-DIS for disorienting responses).
* **User Interpretation (I-):** This column captures the researcher's interpretation or cognitive processing of the AI's response (e.g., I-STRUCT for structuring, I-DIST for emotional distortion).
* **Intensity:** This column denotes the perceived emotional or interaction intensity at a given point.


## Context and Privacy

This dataset is deeply personal, documenting a unique autoethnographic journey. All sensitive personal details and identifiable information within the dialogue snippets have been rigorously anonymized or generalized to ensure the privacy of the researcher. The focus of this data is on the structural patterns and interpretative processes of emotional interaction, not on specific autobiographical events.

## Usage

This dataset is shared to enhance the transparency and reproducibility of the research presented in the paper. It is intended for academic use by researchers interested in human-AI interaction, autoethnography, emotional computing, and the study of neurotypical 2e individuals. Please cite the accompanying paper if you use this data in your work.
