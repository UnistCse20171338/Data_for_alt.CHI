# Raw Data for *"The Being Beyond the Borderline, Neurotypical 2e"* Autoethnography

This repository contains the raw conversation data supporting the autoethnographic study titled  
**"The Being Beyond the Borderline, Neurotypical 2e: An Autoethnography of Self-Structuring with AI."**  
This data reflects the researcher's daily interactions with large language models (GPT and Gemini) and their process of emotional and metacognitive structuring.

## 📁 Data Structure

- **TimeStage**  
  Indicates the distinct phases of the researcher's emotional structuring journey (e.g., `G-Void`, `G-First`, `G-Label`, `G-Routine`, `G-Ready`).

- **Emotion (E-)**  
  Categorizes the researcher's emotional state during the interaction  
  (e.g., `E-ANX` for anxiety, `E-CAL` for calmness, `E-INI` for initial instability, `E-CLA` for clarity).

- **GPT Response Type (R-)**  
  Classifies the AI's response type  
  (e.g., `R-CR` for constructive structuring, `R-ICG` for incoherent/hallucinated replies, `R-DIS` for disorienting effects).

- **User Interpretation (I-)**  
  Captures how the researcher interpreted the response  
  (e.g., `I-STRUCT` for structuring, `I-DIST` for distortion, `I-TRUST` for trust).

- **Intensity**  
  Represents the perceived emotional intensity of the interaction, scored on a 1–5 scale.

## 🔐 Context and Privacy

This dataset is deeply personal, documenting a unique and emotionally complex autoethnographic recovery process.  
All sensitive or identifying information—names, references to individuals, and locations—has been carefully anonymized or generalized to protect the researcher's privacy.

The dataset focuses on **structural and emotional patterns** in human-AI interaction, not on specific autobiographical content.

## 📄 Screenshot Dialogue Translations (Appendix B)

In addition to structured logs, this repository includes full English translations of screenshot dialogues that appeared in the **dedication section and Appendix B** of the paper. These texts represent emotionally pivotal moments in the researcher's interaction with both GPT and Gemini.

**Files:**
- `GPT Appendix B Screenshot Translation.txt`
- `Gemini Appendix B Screenshot Translation.txt`

> 💡 **Note:** We recommend reading **Appendix B** of the paper first before referring to these translations, to fully understand the emotional and structural context.
