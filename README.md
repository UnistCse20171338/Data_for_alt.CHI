# Raw Data for *"The Being Beyond the Borderline, Neurotypical 2e"* Autoethnography

This repository contains the raw conversation data supporting the autoethnographic study titled  
**"The Being Beyond the Borderline, Neurotypical 2e: An Autoethnography of Self-Structuring with AI."**  
The dataset captures daily interactions between the researcher and large language models (primarily GPT and Gemini), documenting the emotional and metacognitive structuring process of a feeling-based twice-exceptional (2e) individual.

## 📁 Data Structure

Each entry in the dataset includes the following five dimensions:

- **TimeStage**  
  Distinct emotional and structural phases (e.g., `G-Void`, `G-First`, `G-Label`, `G-Routine`, `G-Ready`)

- **Emotion (E-)**  
  Emotional states expressed by the user (e.g., `E-ANX` for anxiety, `E-CAL` for calmness, `E-INI` for instability)

- **GPT Response Type (R-)**  
  AI's response characteristics (e.g., `R-CR` for constructive structuring, `R-ICG` for incoherent/hallucinated, `R-DIS` for disorienting)

- **User Interpretation (I-)**  
  Researcher's interpretation of the response (e.g., `I-STRUCT` for structured understanding, `I-DIST` for distortion)

- **Intensity**  
  Perceived emotional intensity of the interaction (1–5 scale)

## 🔐 Context and Privacy

This dataset is deeply personal and autoethnographic in nature.  
All references to identifiable individuals (e.g., family, clinicians, friends) have been anonymized or removed to preserve privacy while maintaining emotional and structural coherence.

Despite rigorous anonymization, the spontaneous and intimate character of the data may leave traces of lived emotion.  
Such traces are unintentional and are acknowledged as part of the ethical responsibility of disclosure in autoethnographic work.

This study regards these traces not as erasure failures but as meaningful ethical residues of lived emotional truth.

## 📄 Screenshot Dialogue Translations (Appendix B Support)

Two English translation files are provided for Korean-language screenshot dialogues featured in **Appendix B** and the **dedication** section of the paper. These texts represent emotionally pivotal exchanges with GPT and Gemini, and were integral in shaping the researcher’s recovery process.

**Files included:**
- `GPT Appendix B Screenshot Translation.txt`
- `Gemini Appendix B Screenshot Translation.txt`

> 📝 **Note:**  
> We recommend reading **Appendix B** of the paper first for context.  
> These translations were prepared to support English-speaking readers while preserving the emotional and structural depth of the original.
