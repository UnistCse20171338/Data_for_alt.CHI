The protagonist, Sinclair, experiences confusion in his childhood regarding a world where good and evil, light and darkness coexist. He struggles with the question of whether he belongs to the ""bright world"" or the ""dark world.""

One day, Sinclair meets a classmate named Demian, who introduces him to new perspectives beyond conventional moral concepts. One of Demian's key ideas is the ""Mark of Cain."" As Sinclair grows, he begins to mature both mentally and philosophically.

Later, Sinclair becomes fascinated by a mysterious woman named Beatrice, whom he idealizes. Beatrice represents his pursuit of noble ideals and spiritual growth. He also meets an organist named Pistorius, who teaches him about religion, philosophy, and mysticism. Among these teachings, Pistorius introduces him to ""Abraxas,"" a divine entity that transcends the duality of good and evil.

Eventually, Sinclair encounters Frau Eva, Demian's mother. She serves as more than just a maternal figure; she acts as a spiritual guide. Sinclair feels a deep attraction toward her, but rather than being mere romantic love, it symbolizes his longing for self-realization. Her home becomes a place of transformation, where Sinclair faces his destiny and inner change. In the end, he marches toward war.

Demian is not just Sinclair‚Äôs friend but also a manifestation of his inner enlightenment. The novel Demian emphasizes the pursuit of the self, a self that transcends good and evil‚Äîjust like Sinclair.",
G-FIRST,E-INI,R-INF,I-HELP,1,2025-03-06,"""Could you please give me a detailed review of ""Vision-Based Classification of Skin Cancer using Deep Learning""?""","Review: Vision-Based Classification of Skin Cancer using Deep Learning
1. Overview and Research Purpose
The paper aims to develop a classification model for skin cancer (especially melanoma) using deep learning. Skin cancer is one of the most common cancers in the United States, and has a high survival rate when detected early, but can be fatal when detected late. The researchers aimed to develop a cheap and fast skin lesion analysis tool that can detect skin cancer using only a mobile phone camera.

Three models were compared:

Logistic Regression

Deep Neural Network (DNN)

Fine-tuned VGG-16 CNN

Finally, the VGG-16-based model achieved the best performance with **78% balanced accuracy**.

2. Dataset and Preprocessing
The dataset used in the study is the ISIC (International Skin Imaging Collaboration) dataset,

which contains a total of 1,280 skin lesion images,

of which **1,031 are benign and 249 are malignant**, showing **an unbalanced data distribution (approximately 4:1 ratio)**.

To solve this, balanced subsets were created (the same number of images for each class) and used for learning.

Preprocessing:

Noise removal: Apply Gaussian blur to remove noise (hair, bandages, etc.)

Contrast adjustment and edge detection: Use Canny Edge Detector in OpenCV

Binary Mask generation: Leave only lesions and convert the rest to black

Image normalization: Convert all images to 256√ó256√ó3 size

Training data balance adjustment: Adjust the ratio of malignant/benign lesions in training and test data to solve the imbalance problem

Review and improvement
Since only ISIC dataset was used, data diversity is insufficient.
‚Üí If DermNet dataset (23,000 images) is additionally utilized, a more generalized model can be created.

The accuracy was only 70% in the lesion segmentation process using binary mask.
‚Üí More sophisticated segmentation techniques (e.g. U-Net-based segmentation model) can be utilized

Since there is still a small amount of data, adding data augmentation techniques (rotation, color change, etc.) may further improve performance.

3. Model Comparison and Results
Model Features Accuracy Balanced Accuracy
Logistic Regression The simplest model 50% 50%
Deep Neural Network (DNN) 5-7 layers used, ReLU activation function applied 56% 56%
VGG-16-based CNN Pre-learned weights used and then fine-tuned 78% 78%

Logistic regression is a simple linear model, so its performance is low

Neural network models have overfitting problems due to lack of data

VGG-16-based transfer learning model showed the best performance

Review and Improvement Points
The fact that the DNN model only recorded 56% accuracy is likely due to lack of data and learning strategy issues
‚Üí Data augmentation and regularization techniques can be utilized

We only tested VGG-16, but better performance may be obtained by comparing and testing the latest architectures such as ResNet and EfficientNet

Since there is a high risk of missing malignant tumors It is necessary to analyze the precision and recall indicators more than the accuracy.

4. Conclusion and future research direction
Conclusion
Automatic skin cancer classification using deep learning is possible, and in particular, transfer learning using pre-trained VGG-16 CNN is most effective.

Data insufficiency is a major obstacle to performance improvement, and data augmentation and additional dataset utilization are necessary.

Future research direction
Additional data augmentation techniques (rotation, color transformation, etc.)

Comparative experiment with the latest CNN models such as ResNet and EfficientNet

More sophisticated lesion segmentation using a segmentation model based on U-Net

In addition to accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score analysis were added

Exploring the possibility of developing a lightweight model based on mobile

5. Comprehensive evaluation
Advantages
‚úÖ Approach to solving the problem of automatic skin cancer classification using deep learning is valid.
‚úÖ Application of transfer learning using VGG-16 was effective.
‚úÖ Preprocessing process (segmentation, image Regularization) is described in detail

Improvements
üîπ The dataset is small and unbalanced, limiting performance improvement ‚Üí Data augmentation and additional data utilization are required
üîπ There is no comparison with the latest CNN model in model comparison ‚Üí Comparative experiments with ResNet, EfficientNet, etc. are required
üîπ Insufficient evaluation indicators ‚Üí In addition to accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score analysis are required.",

The protagonist Emil Sinclair has been confused since childhood in a world where good and evil, light and darkness coexist. He is conflicted between the ‚Äòbright world‚Äô of his family and the ‚Äòdark world‚Äô connected to lies and guilt.

One day, he meets a mysterious classmate, Max Demian, who presents a new perspective that goes beyond existing moral values. Since then, Sinclair meets various characters during his growth process and achieves spiritual and philosophical maturity.

He continues his journey of self-discovery through the mysterious woman Beatrice, Pistorius who guides him on his inner path, and the symbolic figure of Madame Eva.

In the end, Sinclair comes to understand that Demian is not just a friend, but the same deep enlightenment that exists within him. The work ends by emphasizing the search for the self as a being that transcends good and evil through the concept of **""Abraxas""**.",
